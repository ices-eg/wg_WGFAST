== Foreword
:sectnums:

This report documents a convention for the storage of sonar data in netCDF4-formatted computer files, with an initial focus on omnisonars. The intention is to provide a well-founded convention that is supported by multiple sonar systems and multiple sonar analysis software packages, with the aim of facilitating the use of sonar data for research and survey purposes. The name of this convention is SONAR-netCDF4.

This document was developed by the Topic Group on Defining a data format for omnidirectional fisheries sonar, part of ICES Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science, and Technology (WGFAST).

== Introduction

Sonars have long been used to study and understand fisheries and the aquatic environment, but only recently have they directly provided digital data for quantitative analysis. Each manufacturer typically provides such data in a proprietary, but usually open, file format specific to their sonar systems. This hinders the effective use and exchange of such data by requiring the development and maintenance of file-reading software for multiple analysis programs and multiple sonars.

This document presents a convention for the storage and exchange of fisheries sonar data, with an initial focus on omnisonars. It is sufficiently generic and flexible to contain all foreseeable types of fisheries sonar data, along with necessary metadata. It also serves as a statement of the minimum set of data and metadata required to use omnisonar data in a quantitative manner.

=== Background

Many purpose-built file formats exist to store and exchange data from scientific and industrial equipment. Formats have been created by sonar and echosounder manufacturers; in addition, more generic acoustic data formats such as the Generic Water Column (GWC) format cite:[geeMultibeamWaterColumn2012], the eXtended Triton Format (XTF; citenp:[triton2013]), and the HydroACoustics (HAC) format cite:[mcquinn2005] have also been created. These formats store a time-ordered sequence of datagrams, making it easy to append new data. Other data, such as geographical position, are typically interleaved into the sequence of datagrams. However, this is not optimal for analysis purposes when data are viewed and analysed as a set of pings and metadata from a time-period or spatial grouping. In addition, efficient random-read access to individual pings is not possible unless an index is available or created.

The Topic Group on Defining a data format for omnidirectional fisheries sonar do not want to create yet another sonar-specific file format; the knowledge required is not within the expertise of this group. However, the group does have the expertise to specify what data must be stored to allow for unambiguous use of backscatter data during quantitative analysis.

Accordingly, an existing file-format definition has been utilized and what should be stored is specified. The requirements for such a file format definition were:

* ability to adequately represent the content and structure of sonar data and associated metadata;
* standardized, open-file format;
* fast random access to data stored in the file;
* ability to store multiple types of data (e.g. position and backscatter);
* ability to store metadata (e.g. sonar settings);
* freely available and open libraries to read the data files into programming languages and technical computing environments (e.g. Java, C, C++, Python, Matlab, and R);
* reliable and space-efficient format for data exchange and storage;
* self-describing file format;
* backwards compatibility upon modification of the file contents specification (i.e. old software/tools can still read relevant parts of a newer version);
* computer platform-independent;
* long-term support and extensive use in other scientific fields;
* support for very large datasets.

Other scientific communities that collect and produce voluminous amounts of data have addressed similar needs, resulting in the Hierarchical Data Format cite:[thehdfgroup2017], currently at version 5 (HDF5). This is the only file format that meets all the listed requirements and is utilized for sonar data. There are two realizations of the HDF5 file format: (i) HDF5 itself and (ii) netCDF4 cite:[unidata2017], which is a subset of HDF5. Both are sufficient, but netCDF4 is more widely used and has slightly wider language support and implementation diversity. Accordingly, netCDF4 has been chosen.

Using a well-supported file format has the significant benefit that many data exploration, query, extraction, and analysis tools already read such files. This eliminates the need to develop and maintain sonar-specific file-reading software and facilitates the use of existing tools for data management, distribution, and analysis (a pertinent example is OPeNDAP, which provides a network-transparent standard for distributing scientific data).

An attractive feature of netCDF4 is the ease and transparency with which data can be added to an existing netCDF4 file. For example, processed data and how it was obtained can be included in the same file as the raw data. In addition, netCDF4 files can be very large while still providing fast access to data subsets. This allows a single SONAR-netCDF4 file to contain data from a transect or an entire survey. These features would simplify data management, improve traceability and long-term storage of analysis, enhance the sharing of processed datasets, and facilitate analysis of large disparate datasets. In general, any amount of additional data can be stored in the files without affecting the ability to use the data specified by the SONAR-netCDF4 convention.

A distinction is commonly made between file formats designed for archiving data in the original form, formats designed for storing partially or fully processed data, and formats for data exchange cite:[jackson2014]. The SONAR-netCDF4 convention is intended to be suitable for all of these.

The initial focus of this convention has been to specify the storage of backscatter amplitude data from omnisonars. It is envisaged that future versions could specify how to store data from other acoustic equipment (e.g. echosounders) and derived data (e.g. bottom and school detections, categorization of backscatter, and integrated backscatter at multiple resolutions). Ancillary information such as sonar display screen-grabs could also be stored.

=== Versioning

This document and the convention that it describes will change over time to implement enhancements and to correct errors and omissions. To accommodate this, the SONAR-netCDF4 convention always requires a version number. This document has a separate version number, allowing for revised versions of the document to describe the same version of the convention.

The convention version number will always be included in the title of the document. The document version number will always be found in <<_revision_history>>.

== The recommended use of the SONAR-netCDF4 convention in post processing software

There are several processing steps that are common among the different postprocessing tools used by the community, and there is a growing need to use the different tools interchangeably. This chapter describes a few standard processing steps and outlines how the convention is intended to be used to facilitate the interchangeability. Note that the steps may be different between tools, and the convention only recommends how to store the data for the steps that are most common. We do not address how and in which order to process your data.

Exchange of information between different parts in the processing chain is becoming increasingly important. This is particularly relevant for emerging deep learning and machine learning frameworks, that have hardware requirements that are often different to the computers that are used for traditional desktop applications. Processing tools that run on autonomous platforms are also a need, which often require a different suite of software solutions, typically tailored to low power situations. 

Typical steps in the postprocessing chain of marine sonar data consist of preprocessing and noise removal, bottom detection, classification, and integration (<<postprocessing_data_flow_figure>>). Here we outline the different groups in the convention that can support the input and output from these steps. If a processing software step can read the data, process the information and write back to the data using the convention, other software can pick it up and process it further. 

.Typical steps in a postprocessing chain for acoustical water column data. The two main groups may be used for several steps depending on the objective, and the `GridGroup` may be seen as a projection of the `BeamGroup` and the conversion to `GridGroup` is typically lossy. The output from the sonars are typically the `BeamGroup` and the report format are typically the `GridGroup`.
[[postprocessing_data_flow_figure]]

=== Typical processing steps and the associated data models

Two main data models are available in the convention: `Beam_group` and `Grid_group`. The `Beam_group` allows for different sample rates, different ping rates, etc, for each channel. It is a flexible model and able to cope with all echosounders and sonar systems. The `Grid_group` is a storage structure for multi-channel data that has  been re-gridded or have a homogeneous ping times and range bins across the different frequencies.

Depending on the type of processing, both `Beam_group` and `Grid_group` could be used as input and output.

==== Denoising

==== Bottom detection
Bottom data is needed when integrating biological backscatter close to the sea bed. Different algorithms have been developed and the recommendation is to store the bottom depth in the `Beam_group`.

==== Labelling
Scrutinizing acoustic data, i.e. allocating the acoustic energy to categories, is traditionally achieved by manually assigning the backscatter. Both `Beam_group` and `Grid_group` support labels. An overview of how different software stores this information can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5ub9-ElnGWgoFzOhwrNiAB6fZRhKI8Nw6FskMhzI0g/edit#heading=h.ihw2gdxqw9td[Gavins label overview]

==== Machine learning
Convolutional neural networks and other machine learning methods are suitable for processing sonar data, but it is typically more convenient to map the data to a common range, time and frequency grid before passinsg it into your preferred deep learning framework. The use of the `Grid_group` on a high resolution grid should be used for this purpose.


==== Integrated backscatter
The reports from the integration process typically goes into statistical paclages that can furhter process the data. It is recommended to use the `Grid_group` for this purpose, where the data is gridded typically on a coarser grid that that used for the machine learning objective

== The SONAR-netCDF4 convention

=== Introduction

NetCDF4 is a data model, application programming interface (API) library, and file format for storing and managing data, developed and maintained by Unidata. Unidata is part of the US University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (http://www2.ucar.edu/[UCAR]) Community Programs (http://www.ucp.ucar.edu/[UCP]) and funded primarily by the US National Science Foundation.

SONAR-netCDF4 is a data and metadata convention for the storage of data from active sonars in netCDF4 formatted files. SONAR-netCDF4 consists primarily of a naming convention and a data structure within the netCDF4 data model.

Datasets can be added to SONAR-netCDF4 files if they do not conflict with the SONAR-netCDF4 datasets. If such additions are potentially of use to other users of the file format, it is recommended that they be proposed for inclusion in this or additional convention specifications.

Each SONAR-netCDF4 file is intended to store data from one sonar mounted on one platform. The storage of data from multiple sonars and multiple platforms in one SONAR-netCDF4 file is not in the scope of the convention.

A design principle of SONAR-netCDF4 has been to focus on describing the acoustic backscatter data, not the overall purpose and context of why the data were collected. Such broader metadata are better stored in separate metadata systems and schema (e.g. citenp:[iso2014,ices2016]).



=== Hierarchical structure

NetCDF4 has two main organizational concepts: (i) the variable, which can contain a variety of data structures, and (ii) groups, being a collection of variables. Groups and variables can have attributes attached to them. Groups can be arranged into a hierarchy.

SONAR-netCDF4 divides sonar data into seven netCDF4 groups:

. *Top-level –* contains metadata about the SONAR-netCDF4 file format;
. *Annotation –* contains time-stamped annotations;
. *Environment –* contains information relevant to acoustic propagation through water;
. *Platform* *–* contains information about the platform on which the sonar is installed;
. *Provenance –* contains metadata about how the SONAR-netCDF4 version of the data were obtained;
. *Sonar –* contains the backscatter and associated metadata; groups under Sonar are used for storing data from different sonar operating modes;
. *Vendor specific –* contains vendor-specific information about the sonar and the data.

These groups contain variables and variable attributes with prescribed names and contents.

=== Obligations and missing data

Some variables and attributes in SONAR-netCD4 are mandatory; these form the minimal set of data required to quantitatively use backscattering amplitude data. The remaining variables and attributes have various levels of optionality and provide enhanced context and information about the sonar data. The obligations are:

. *M*: mandatory
. *MA*: mandatory if applicable or available
. *R*: recommended
. *O*: optional

Any non-mandatory variables can be absent from a SONAR-netCDF4 file. If a variable is mandatory, it must be present and must contain data. The set of mandatory variables and attributes has been chosen so that omnisonar systems can directly generate SONAR-netCDF4-conforming files without needing survey, experiment, or cruise-specific data.

The _FillValue attribute should be used to indicate missing data in variables. For floating point values, the IEEE 754 not-a-number (NaN) is the preferred fill value as this is convenient for commonly-used analysis packages (e.g. Python, Matlab, R).

=== Metadata and authorities

The fisheries acoustics community has developed a metadata convention for processed acoustic data cite:[ices2016]. Where relevant, attribute and variable names have been reused from this convention. The NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions cite:[eatonNetCDFClimateForecast2017] have been used where sensible (the efficient storage of unprocessed active sonar data has not been a design goal of the CF convention) along with the ESIP Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD). Terms and concepts from other metadata conventions have also been used where appropriate.

=== Units

All relevant variables and attributes in SONAR-netCDF4 files are required to have a textual netCDF4 attribute with the name “units” that specifies the units. The International System of Units (SI) is used. For simplicity, the data format mandates the use of particular units and their textual form, as per the definitions and conventions of the UDUNITS-2 package cite:[ucar2014]. Decibels are commonly used in underwater acoustic quantities, but UDUNITS does not currently include such a unit. However, as the CF convention does permit decibel (with symbols: “dB”, “db”, and “dbel”), it is used in the SONAR-netCDF4 convention.

=== Datatypes

Each item has a suggested datatype, chosen to have sufficient range and precision to contain the expected data. Alternative datatypes can be used if necessary, but are discouraged. The “string” type should contain text in the UTF-8 encoding and should be treated as case-sensitive during any comparisons. Enumerated datatypes are used for some of the controlled vocabularies.

=== Vocabularies

The contents of some variables and attributes are restricted to defined vocabularies. These are listed or referenced where required. Desired additions to the vocabularies should be proposed to WGFAST for incorporation into this document. Some of the vocabularies have been represented as netCDF4 enumeration data types and some using the CF flag_values convention.

=== File-naming convention

SONAR-netCDF4 files should always end with a “.nc” suffix to indicate that they are a netCDF file. It is recommended that the filename should sort alphanumerically into chronological order (e.g. date and time of the first ping in the file; thus: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.nc). This facilitates file management and use in analysis systems.

=== CDL version of SONAR-netCDF4

An example of a SONAR-netCDF4 file is provided in the Common Data form Language (CDL). This provides a more formalized and structured representation of the data format. A CDL file can be converted into a NetCDF file using the “ncgen” utility (available as part of the netCDF software distribution) and then used as a template for creating populated SONAR-netCDF4 files.

=== Groups

==== Top-level group

The top-level group contains metadata about the SONAR-netCDF4 file, represented as attributes in the group (<<topLevelTable>>).

.Description of the top-level group.
[[topLevelTable]]
include::tableToplevel.adoc[]

==== Annotation group

The annotation group contains timestamped annotations with optional identification code. Annotations are typically textual notes entered by users relevant to the data at a particular time. Some sonar systems provide an interface for creating manual and programmatic annotations. The netCDF4 group name is */Annotation* and is described in <<annotationTable>>.

include::tableAnnotation.adoc[]

==== Environment group

The environment group contains information on environmental conditions, especially the speed of sound in water and acoustic absorption. The netCDF4 group name is */Environment* and is described in <<environmentTable>>. Sound speed, absorption, and current profiles can also be stored in this group, as can profile measurements of salinity, temperature, and pressure. Such profile data should use the NCEI NetCDF “profile” template, v2.0 or greater.

.Description of the environment group.
[[environmentTable]]
include::tableEnvironment.adoc[]

==== Platform group

This group contains information about the sonar platform (e.g. ship). The netCDF4 group name is */Platform* and is described in <<platformGroupTable>>. Optionally, subgroups of /Platform can be used to store data from individual instruments that provide measurements about the platform, such as position, attitude, etc (note that if the measurements are about the environment around the platform they should be stored in the /Environment group). This structure must be used to store all instrument data. 

Each platform can contain several instruments of the same type, such as multiple position sensors. Each instrument type is defined as a subgroup of the /Platform group and data for each instrument are stored in a subgroup of the instrument group. Subgroup names for common instrument types are given in <<platformInstrumentsTable>> and how to store data from those instruments are also cross-referenced in <<platformInstrumentsTable>>. For example, data from individual position and attitude instruments are stored as subgroups of the /Platform/Position and /Platform/Attitude subgroups. The names of those subgroups must match the names of the instrument's serial number or identifier as defined in the MRU_ids and position_ids variables in the /Platform group (<<platformGroupTable>>).  Additional instrument type subgroups can be created as required.

Each instrument group can also store unprocessed and unparsed sensor data. The data format for unprocessed and unparsed data is not prescribed, but could, for example, be NMEA-style text and/or numeric values. These subgroups must have one attribute called “description” that provides a short description of the contents. Other attributes can be added as desired. The variables under the subgroup should have appropriate names and an attribute that gives the units, where appropriate.

As a general example, parsed data from a GPS with id _Garmin1234_ would be stored in /Platform/Position/Garmin1234 and if NMEA data from that GPS were also stored, it would be in /Platform/Position/Garmin1234/NMEA.

The coordinate system convention used for the /Platform group variables is detailed in <<_coordinate_systems>>.

==== Sonar group

This group contains the sonar backscatter data and associated metadata. The netCDF4 group name is */Sonar* and is described in <<sonarGroupTable>>.

Data from each beam mode (e.g. horizontal and vertical beam modes) are stored in subgroups under the /Sonar group (see <<sonarBeammodeTable>>). The form of the backscatter data can vary between different sonar systems. For example, some provide a complex-valued amplitude, while others provide a real- or integer-valued amplitude. Variable definitions for data from split-aperture systems are not currently specified.

Subgroups under /Sonar each have a coordinate variable that contains ping timestamps. In some cases the coordinate variables in different subgroups contain the same data (such as when a sonar produces several types of beam data from each and every ping). To avoid duplication of timestamp data, a coordinate variable can be used across multiple subgroups. For organisational reasons, it is then recommended that such coordinate variables be located in the /Sonar group.

==== Vendor specific group

The vendor specific group contains information about the sonar and data specific to the sonar. Data in this group must not be necessary for normal quantitative use of the sonar data. The contents of this group are at the discretion of the sonar and software that writes the SONAR-netCDF4 file. The netCDF4 group name is */Vendor_specific*. Currently, there is no mandatory information for the vendor specific group.

== Conversion equations

This section provides detailed formulae on how to convert the backscatter data in the Sonar group into calibrated target strength and volume backscatter strength.

=== Type 1

Type 1 conversion equations are used for data recorded by the Simrad SU90, SX90, and SH90 omnisonars and are presented in detail by citenp:[macaulay2016].

The complex-valued backscatter data are converted into calibrated target strength via:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
TS = 10 \log_{10}(P_{r}) + 40\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_t\lambda^{2}}{16\pi^2}\right) - G - 40\log_{10}(\cos\gamma),
\end{equation}
++++

where latexmath:[P_r] is linearly proportional to the received power (square of the magnitude of the complex number given by backscatter_r and backscatter_i, W) and _r_ is the range between the transducer and target, calculated from:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation} \label{eq:timeToRange}
r = \frac{c ( dt \cdot i - t_0)}{2},
\end{equation}
++++

where _c_ is sound speed (NetCDF4 variable is sound_speed_indicative, m/s), _dt_ is the time between recorded samples (sample_interval, s), _i_ is the sample number (from zero to one less than the number of samples), and latexmath:[t_0] is a time-offset (sample_time_offset-blanking_interval, s).

The absorption coefficient of sound in water is _α_ (absorption_indicative, dB/m), latexmath:[P_t] is the transmit power (transmit_power, W), latexmath:[\lambda] is the acoustic wavelength (derived from the average of transmit_frequency_start and transmit_frequency_stop, and sound_speed_indicative, m), _G_ is the transducer gain (transducer_gain, dB)_,_ and latexmath:[\gamma] is the beam tilt angle (derived from beam_direction_x, beam_direction_y, beam_direction_z, degrees from horizontal).

The volume backscatter strength (Sv, citenp:[maclennan2002]) is derived from a similar equation:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
S_{v} = 10\log_{10}(P_{r}) + 20\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_t\lambda^{2}c\psi\tau_{e}}{32\pi^{2}}\right) - G - 40\log_{10}(\cos\gamma),
\end{equation}
++++

where latexmath:[\psi] is the equivalent beam angle (equivalent_beam_angle, sr), latexmath:[\tau_e] is the effective pulse duration (transmit_duration_equivalent, s), and _G_ is the transducer gain (transducer_gain, dB).

=== Type 2

Type 2 conversion equations are intended for data recorded by Furuno omnisonars. The received real-valued backscatter data are converted into calibrated target strength via:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
TS = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 40\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - (SL + K + \Delta G + G_{T}),
\end{equation}
++++

where _A_ (backscatter_r, 1) is linearly proportional to the amplitude of the received echo , _r_ is the range as given by equation \eqref{eq:timeToRange}, and _α_ is the absorption coefficient of sound in water (absorption_indicative, dB/m). _SL_ is source level (transmit_source_level, dB re 1μPa at 1 m) and _K_ is receiver sensitivity (receiver_sensitivity, dB re 1/μPa). Both parameters may depend on tilt angle of the beam for transmitting and receiving.

Gain correction, latexmath:[\Delta G], (gain_correction, dB) is determined by the calibration. Time-varied gain, latexmath:[G_T] (time_varied_gain, dB), is given at each sample number _i_.

The volume backscatter strength is derived from a similar equation:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
S_v = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + 20\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{c\tau_e}{2}\Psi \right) - (SL + K + \Delta G + G_T),
\end{equation}
++++

where _c_ is sound speed (sound_speed_indicative, m/s), latexmath:[\tau_e] is the effective pulse duration (transmit_duration_equivalent, s), and latexmath:[\Psi] is the equivalent beam angle (equivalent_beam_angle, sr). Considering the time-varied-gain (TVG) effect on the echo shape cite:[sawada1993], the replacement of _r_ by latexmath:[r - r_0], where latexmath:[r_0 = \frac{1}{4} c \tau_e], is recommended cite:[maclennan1986,furusawaRangeErrorsSound1999] for calculation of latexmath:[S_v].

=== Type 3

Type 3 conversion equations are intended for data produced by Simrad EK60, ES60, and ES70 echosounders.

The backscatter power values are stored in the _backscatter_r_ variable with data type _short_ (16-bit signed integers) that are converted to logarithmic received power via:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
P_r = \frac{10\log_{10}(2)}{256} P_c, 
\end{equation}
++++
where latexmath:[P_c] is the compressed power value stored in the _backscatter_r_ variable and latexmath:[P_r] the logarithmic received power that is transformed into calibrated target strength via:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
TS = P_r + 40\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_t\lambda^{2}}{16\pi^2} \right) - 2G_0,
\end{equation}
++++
where latexmath:[r] is the range from the transducer to the target [m], latexmath:[\alpha] the acoustic absorption [dB m^-1^], latexmath:[P_t] the transmitted power setting (_transmit_power_ variable), latexmath:[\lambda] the acoustic wavelength [m], and latexmath:[G_0] the on-axis gain (variable _transducer_gain_). Volume backscatter strength is obtained from a similar equation:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
S_v = P_r + 20\log_{10}(r) + 2\alpha r - 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_t \lambda^2 c \psi \tau}{32 \pi^2} \right) - 2G_0 - 2S_{a,corr},
\end{equation}
++++

where latexmath:[c] is sound speed [m s^-1^], latexmath:[\psi] the equivalent beam angle (variable _equivalent_beam_angle_), latexmath:[\tau] the pulse duration (variable _transmit_duration_nominal_), and latexmath:[S_{a,corr}] a correction term (variable _sa_correction_).

The range from the transducer to the target is given by:

=== Type 4

Type 4 conversion equations are intended for data produced by Simrad EK80 and ES80 broadband echosounders.

== Coordinate systems

=== Platform coordinate system

The coordinate system for the platform uses the right-handed Cartesian convention (<<coordinate_system_figure>>) with:

* _x_-axis parallel to the main axis of the platform, positive values toward the front of the platform (e.g. toward the bow of a ship),
* _y_-axis perpendicular to the main axis of the platform, positive values to the starboard side of the platform,
* _z_-axis vertical, positive values down from the platform,
* the origin is the common reference point where all three axes meet and is arbitrary.

Roll is positive with port side up, pitch is positive with bow up, and heading/yaw is positive clockwise. More specifically:

* looking along the positive _x_-axis, a positive rotation (roll) is clockwise (to starboard),
* looking along the positive _y_-axis, a positive rotation (pitch) is clockwise (bow up),
* looking along the positive _z_-axis, a positive rotation (yaw) is clockwise (to starboard).

The platform-heading variable (degrees clockwise from north) can be used to obtain the sonar orientation in world coordinates. This applies to both stationary and mobile sonar platforms.

The orientation of the platform is represented using the _z_–_y_’–_x_” Tait-Bryan intrinsic rotation convention (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles]), corresponding to yaw, pitch, and roll, respectively. Intrinsic means that rotations about the _y_-axis are measured after any rotation about the _z_-axis, and rotations about the _x_-axis are measured after rotations about the _y_-axis (for comparison, extrinsic angles are applied relative to a fixed-platform orientation). This is the most used rotation convention in the maritime field, and the main effect is that roll is measured relative to the plane tilted by the pitch angle.

=== Sonar beam coordinate system

The sonar beam coordinate system origin and orientation is given by a set of rotations and translations from the platform coordinate system. These are:

. transducer offset
. transducer rotation
. if motion compensated, pitch, roll, and yaw
. sonar beam rotation

The sonar beam coordinate systems (_x'_, _y'_, _z'_) are defined by per-beam rotations of the platform coordinate system (_x_, _y_, _z_). A translation may also occur if the origin of the sonar beam coordinate system differs from the platform coordinate system. The _z'_ axis is always the beam axis, with the origin at the transducer.

The rotation is given by three rotation angles (latexmath:[\alpha, \beta, \gamma]), corresponding to a clockwise extrinsic z-x-z rotation of the platform coordinate system. That is, the beam coordinate system is the result of three rotations of the platform coordinate system, performed in this order:

.  Rotate about the _z_-axis by latexmath:[\gamma]
.  Rotate about the _x_-axis by latexmath:[\beta]
.  Rotate about the _z_-axis by latexmath:[\alpha]

The SONAR-netCD4 variable names for receive beam rotation angles are _rx_beam_rotation_alpha_, _rx_beam_rotation_beta_, and _rx_beam_rotation_gamma_. Translations are given by the _transducer_offset_x_, _transducer_offset_y_, and _transducer_offset_z_ variables. 

Sonar beams can be compensated or uncompensated for platform motion. If compensated, the sonar beam coordinate system is taken to be relative to the platform coordinate system prior to the effect of any pitch and roll of the platform. If uncompensated, the true orientation of the beam coordinate system can be obtained by applying platform pitch and roll to the platform coordinate system and hence to the beam coordinate system. The _beam_stabilisation_ variable indicates whether the beams are compensated or uncompensated.

==== Split-aperture coordinates

Some sonar beams can estimate the arrival angle of echoes (<<Split-aperture beams>>). These angles are given as _minor_ and _major_ angles in the sonar beam coordinate system (<<split_aperture_angle_figure>>):

* The _z'_ -axis is always the beam axis with the origin at the receive transducer,
* The _minor_ arrival angle (latexmath:[\phi]) is given by the angle from the _z'_ axis, measured in the _x'_-_z'_ plane, and
* The _major_ arrival angle (latexmath:[\theta]) is given by the angle from the _z'_ axis measured in the _y'_-_z'_ plane.

Positive minor angles occur in the positive _x'_ plane and positive major angles occur in the positive _y'_ plane. 

For conventional downward-looking echosounders mounted on a ship, without motion compensation, it is normal that the beam coordinate system is identical to the platform coordinate system (latexmath:[\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 0]), and hence the split-aperture minor angle is oriented alongships with positive angles towards the bow and the split-aperture major angle is oriented athwartships with positive angles to starboard.

=== Coordinate systems offsets and rotations

Several coordinate system offsets can be given in the Platform group. These allow for precise specification of the origin of sensors, such as the position and attitude sensors, and sonar transducer. The offset is a (x,y,z) tuple in the platform coordinate system. Offsets are to be interpreted as a vector that starts at the platform coordinate system origin and ends at the sensor position. For example, an offset of (1, 2, –3) indicates a position that is 1 m toward the bow, 2 m to starboard, and 3 m above the origin of the platform coordinate system.

Some sensors (e.g. the attitude sensor) can have a rotation relative to the platform-coordinate system. This is represented as the extrinsic rotation required from the platform coordinate system’s _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axes to arrive at the sensor’s _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-axes.

== Split-aperture beams

Some sonar beams can estimate the arrival angle of echoes using the split-aperture method and SONAR-netCDF4 supports several ways to provide such angles. The type of split-aperture beam data contained in a SONAR-netCDF4 file is given by the _beam_type_ variable in each <<sonarBeammodeTable,Beam_groupX>> subgroup. Split-aperture echo arrival angles are always given in the beam coordinate system (see <<Sonar beam coordinate system>>).

When sub-beams from a split-aperture transducer are provided, it is also necessary to combine the them to give the power or amplitude of the echoes, as received by the combined beam. All known split-aperture systems achieve this by taking the average of the sub-beam values, noting that the sub-beam data are typically complex power or amplitude values.

To allow for existing conventions on how the split-aperture angles are stored or derived (typically as phase angles between the split-aperture signals), angle sensitivities are given in variables _echoangle_major_sensitivity_ and _echoangle_minor_sensitivity_.

=== Angles stored in file
The calculation of the echo arrival angle is done by the sonar and the SONAR-netCDF4 file contains either physical arrival angles or phase angles. For the latter, the major (latexmath:[\theta]) and minor (latexmath:[\phi]) physical arrival angles are obtained by dividing by the major latexmath:[\eta_\theta] and minor latexmath:[\eta_\phi] angle sensitivities respectively. For consistency, when physical arrival angles are stored in the file, latexmath:[\eta_\theta] and latexmath:[\eta_\phi] should still be present and be set to 1.0.

=== Angles not stored in file
The sonar does not calculate the echo arrival angle - they are calculated from the split-aperture sub-beams, each of which are stored in the SONAR-netCDF4 files. Several types of sub-beam arrangements are supported (<<transducer_types>>) - the angle calculation methods for each type are given in the following sections. The sub-beams are stored as the _subbeam_ dimension in the backscatter variables in <<sonarBeammodeTable>>, in the same order as labelled in <<transducer_types>>.

.The split-aperture transducer arrangements supported by SONAR-netCDF4 (A: 4 quadrants; B: 3 sub-beams; C; 3+1 sub-beams). The Cartesian coordinates show the orientation of the sonar beam coordinate system relative to the transducer sub-beams (note that the _z'_-axis points into the page). The numbers indicate the sub-beam labels for each type of transducer.

==== Four quadrants (type A)
This arrangement has four equal quadrants in the transducer (<<transducer_types>>, part A) and the major (latexmath:[\theta]) and minor (latexmath:[\phi]) angles are calculated thus:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{\arctan \left( \Im((y_2+y_3)^*), \Re(y_1+y_4) \right)}{\eta_\theta}\\
\phi =   \frac{\arctan \left( \Im((y_1+y_2)^*), \Re(y_3+y_4) \right)}{\eta_\phi} 
\end{equation}
++++
where latexmath:[\arctan] is the four-quadrant inverse tangent, latexmath:[y_x] the complex signal from quadrant latexmath:[x], * indicates the complex conjugate and latexmath:[\Re] and latexmath:[\Im] the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbered signals. The angle sensitivities are latexmath:[\eta_\theta] for the major axis and latexmath:[\eta_\phi] for the minor axis.


==== Three or four sub-beams (type B and C)

This arrangement has either three equal sub-beams (<<transducer_types>>, partB) or a centre sub-beam and three surrounding sub-beams. (<<transducer_types>>, part C). Type C can be treated the same as type B once the centre sub-beam signal is added to each of the outer sub-beam signals. The phase angles between two pairs of the three sub-beams are then given by cite:[bodholt2001, bjorno2017]:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\omega_{31} = \arctan \left( \Im((y_3+y_1)^*), \Re(y_3+y_1) \right) \\
\omega_{32} = \arctan \left( \Im((y_3+y_2)^*), \Re(y_3+y_1) \right)
\end{equation}
++++
where latexmath:[\arctan] is the four-quadrant inverse tangent, latexmath:[y_x] the complex signal from quadrant latexmath:[x], * indicates the complex conjugate and latexmath:[\Re] and latexmath:[\Im] the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbered signals. The major (latexmath:[\theta]) and minor (latexmath:[\phi]) angles are then:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}\eta_\theta} (\omega_{31} + \omega_{32})\\
\phi = \frac{1}{\eta_\phi} (\omega_{32} - \omega_{31})\\
\end{equation}
++++
where latexmath:[\eta_\theta] is the angle sensitivity for the major axis and latexmath:[\eta_\phi] the angle sensitivity for the minor axis.

== Annex 1: Working with netCDF4 files

NetCDF4 files are not commonly used for fisheries acoustics data. To facilitate the use of such files, this section provides simple examples of how to access and use SONAR-netCDF4 files in commonly used programming languages, namely Python, R, and Matlab.

.Python example
[source,python]
----
# Import packages needed to read and view data from netcdf4
from netCDF4 import Dataset
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Name of the netcdf file
filename = 'SU90-D20171107-T195023.nc'

# Open the file
dataset = Dataset(filename)

# Open the group where the backscatter data is located
SonarGr = dataset.groups['Sonar'].groups['Beam_group2']

# Get the backscatter data from the 10th ping and and 31st beam
back_r = SonarGr.variables['backscatter_r'][9,30]
back_i = SonarGr.variables['backscatter_i'][9,30]

# Close dataset
dataset.close()

# Compute the power
power = abs(np.vectorize(complex)(back_r,back_i))**2

# Plot the power of beam
plt.figure(1)
plt.clf()
plt.plot(10*np.log10(power))
plt.xlabel('Sample number')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')
----

.R example
[source,r]
----
library(h5)
SU90_nc <- PATH_TO_SONAR_NETCDF4_FILE

# The h5 package is able to read the example file:
data <- h5file(SU90_nc)

# Show the contents:
data

# List the dimensions of the data sets:
ds <- list.datasets(data)
dims <- lapply(ds, function(x) openDataSet(data, x)@dim)
names(dims) <- ds
dims

# Note that the backscatter data are stored as variable 
# length datatype, so the dimensions in 'dims' does not 
# reflect to the full size of the backscatter data. 
# In this particular file the length of all beams and all 
# pings of both Beam_group1 and Beam_group2 are identical:

bs_r1_name <- "/Sonar/Beam_group2/backscatter_r"
bs_i1_name <- "/Sonar/Beam_group2/backscatter_i"

# Save the real part and set dimension to 
# [length of beams, number of beams, number of pings]:
backscatter1 <- complex(
real=unlist(data[bs_r1_name][10,31]), 
imaginary=unlist(data[bs_i1_name][10,31]))
power <- abs(backscatter1)^2

# Plot the first and second beam of the third ping:
plot(10*log10(power), type="l", 
ylab="Power", xlab="Sample number")

# Close the file:
h5close(data)
----

.Matlab example
[source,matlab]
----
% Example Matlab script to load a SONAR-netCDF4 file using the
% high-level HDF5 functions.

% File to read
file = 'SU90-D20171107-T195023.nc';

% Ping and beam to read
pingNo = 10;
beamNo = 31;

% Read the selected ping/beam from the file
amp_r = h5read(file, '/Sonar/Beam_group2/backscatter_r', [beamNo pingNo], [1 1]);
amp_i = h5read(file, '/Sonar/Beam_group2/backscatter_i', [beamNo pingNo], [1 1]);

% Calculate the power values for the ping.
power = abs(complex(cell2mat(amp_r), cell2mat(amp_i))).^2;

% Plot the power
plot(10*log10(power))
