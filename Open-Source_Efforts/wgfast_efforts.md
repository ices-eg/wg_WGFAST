| ESP3          | https://sourceforge.net/projects/esp3                 | Matlab (standalone available)     | ESP3Â is an open-source software package for visualising and processing active acoustics data, developed at NIWA (Wellington, New Zealand) by the Fisheries Monitoring and Acoustics group. ESP3 is designed for single-beam and split-beam echosounder data. The software has been written mainly for processing fisheries acoustic surveys, with attention to reproducibility, consistency and efficiency. Although ESP3 was initialy developed to visualise and process single, multi-frequency and broadband SIMRAD EK60 and EK80 raw data, it also supports other formats (e.g., NIWA CREST, Furuno FCV-30 and ASL AZFP). The software allows standard post-processing and analysis of fisheries acoustic survey data such as calibration, scrutinisation using in-house algorithms (e.g, bad transmits identification, automated bottom detection, single targets detection and tracking, schools detection, etc.) and others developed by the scientific community (e.g., background noise removal), multi-frequency analysis and echo-integration. | Yoann Ladroit               | yoann.ladroit@niwa.co.nz                        |
| Matecho       | ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/ird/acoustics/survey_kit | Matlab                            | Matecho is an automated processing method to extract information and perform echo-integration and fish shoal extraction from various scientific echo-sounder sources. The procedure allows the semiautomatic cleaning of echogram data and the application of automatic data filters. Echo-integration processing is executed for each depth layer and integrates their characteristics per elementary sampling unit. Sound scattered layers are automatically detected by segmentation from the echo-integrated echogram, and shoals are extracted according to an iterative process of aggregation of filtered echogram echoes that allows, in both cases, the calculation of the ad hoc parameters describing morphological, spatial location and acoustic characteristics of sound scattered layers and shoals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yannick Perrot              | yannick.perrot@ird.fr                           |
