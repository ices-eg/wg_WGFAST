=== About transducer geometry

Transducer geometry refers to the configurable location and orientation of transducers. This Appendix covers:

* Overview of transducer geometry
* About transducer location
* About transducer orientation

[discrete]
==== Overview of transducer geometry

Each transducer may be located in space and oriented as desired. Illustrated below is a schematic displaying the relative positions in space of a reference point, a GPS antenna and a transducer with non-vertical orientation.

===== Platform system reference point

Transducers are always associated with a platform. The system reference point of the platform is at (0,0,0) by definition and defines the position of the platform in the real world (that is, the platform is considered to be, in the real world, wherever it's reference point is).

Please note that the positive Z direction is downwards when the X-Y plane is horizontal (considered to be on a rigid platform that does not pitch and roll).

For many applications, such as a typical ship based echo-integration survey with multiple downward looking transducers, the only aspect of transducer geometry required is the definition of transducer depth (draft, shown in figure above), if desired. Other applications, such as multiple frequency target strength techniques, surveys with non-vertical transducers, and applications that require the position of samples to be precisely located in the world.

==== About transducer location

Locations are all defined relative to a system reference point detailed in the above  section. The coordinate system utilises three axes (X, Y and Z) and their orientation depends upon whether the platform is fixed or mobile.

[discrete]
===== Fixed platform

The platform system reference point (0, 0, 0) is in a platform space where:

* The X axis is defined to run south-north (positive northwards, negative southwards)
* The Y axis is defined to run west-east (positive eastwards, negative westwards)
* The Z axis is defined to run vertically (positive downwards, negative upward)

The geographic location for the platform system reference point is to a specified latitude, longitude and altitude. Positive altitude is upwards.

[discrete]
===== Mobile platform

The platform system reference point (0, 0, 0) is in a platform space where:

* The X axis is defined to run alongship (positive towards the bow, negative towards the stern)
* The Y axis is defined to run athwartship (positive towards starboard, negative towards port)
* The Z axis is considered to run vertically (positive downwards, negative upwards)

The geographic location for the platform system reference point (X = 0, Y = 0) is the latitude and longitude of the GPS antenna as measured by a Global Positioning System (GPS) device. The location of the GPS antenna relative to the system reference point is specified in X, Y coordinates in meters. The altitude of the system reference point (Z = 0) may be specified. Positive altitude is upwards.

To determine the geographic location of a sample point or a single target in geographic coordinates it is also necessary to define the orientation of the transducer as detailed in the following section.

[discrete]
==== About transducer orientation

Transducers are not only located, but also oriented - that is, they point somewhere. Like location, orientation requires three parameters to be specified, in this case angles rather than coordinates. 

The X-Y-Z axes as defined above are taken as a reference for orientation. In summary:

[cols=",",]
|===
a|*For fixed platforms:*

* The X axis runs south-north
* The Y axis runs west-east
* The Z axis runs up-down

a|*For mobile platforms:*

* The X axis runs stern-bow
* The Y axis runs port-starboard
* The Z axis runs up-down

Two angles are used to define the direction in which the acoustic axis is pointing (either elevation and azimuth angles or alongship and athwartship angles). A third angle called the rotation defines the direction of the minor axis of the transducer relative to a vertical plane passing through the https://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Using_Echoview/About_beam_geometry.htm[beam axis]. The rotation of the transducer can only be determined after the definition of the beam direction.

[discrete]
===== Elevation and Azimuth angles

The angles are defined as follows:

* *Elevation* is the angle between the beam axis and the positive Z axis. +
 +
Valid range is 0° to 180°.

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a vertically downward pointing beam
|90° |a horizontal beam
|180° |a vertically upward pointing beam
|===

* *Azimuth* is the angle between the beam axis and the positive X axis (measured clockwise when viewed in the positive Z direction). +
 +
Valid range is 0° to 360° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a northward (or forward) pointing beam
|90° |eastward (or starboard) pointing
|180° |southward (or aft) pointing
|270° |westward (or port) pointing
|===

If the elevation is 0° or 180° then Azimuth is equivalent to a rotation.

[discrete]
===== Along- and Athwartship angles (mobile platform only)

The angles are defined as follows:

* *Alongship* is the angle between the beam axis and the Y-Z plane. +
 +
Valid range is -180° to 180° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a downward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|-90° |a horizontal aft pointing beam
|90° |a horizontal forward pointing beam
|-180° |an upward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|180° |an upward pointing beam in the Y-Z plane
|===

* *Athwartship* is the angle between the beam axis and the X-Z plane.  +
 +
Valid range is -180° to 180° .

[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |defines a downward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|-90° |a horizontal port pointing beam
|90° |degrees a horizontal starboard pointing beam
|-180° |an upward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|180° |an upward pointing beam in the X-Z plane
|===

*Note:* Not all combinations of Alongship and Athwartship angle are valid. If one angle defines a downward pointing beam (-90° to 90°) and the other an upward pointing beam (-180° to -90° or 90° to 180°)  they cannot be describing the same direction!

[discrete]
===== Rotation

* *Rotation* is the angle between the positive minor-axis of the transducer and the vertical plane running through the beam axis (measured in the clockwise direction as seen from the transducer).

Valid range is 0° to 360°.
[%autowidth]
|===
|0° |an upward pointing positive minor-axis
|180° |a downward pointing positive minor-axis
|===

===== In Summary

To determine the three coordinates defining the beam orientation, do the following:

. Determine the pointing direction of the beam axis
+
Use your choice of either elevation-azimuth angles or alongship-athwartship angles.
. Determine the rotation angle of the transducer
+
Remember that the zero reference for the rotation angle is the vertical plane running through the beam axis and therefore that the rotation coordinate can only be meaningfully determined after you have defined the orientation of the beam axis.

*Examples:*

* A transducer beam pointing to starboard at an angle of 45 degrees with the positive minor axis of the transducer pointing forward is defined by either: +
 +
elevation = 45° , azimuth = 90° , rotation = 270° +
 +
-OR- +
 +
alongship = 0° , athwartship = 45° , rotation = 270° +
 

* A transducer beam pointing to port at an angle of 45 degrees with the positive minor axis of the transducer pointing forward is defined by either: +
 +
elevation = 45° , azimuth = 270° , rotation = 90° +
 +
-OR- +
 +
alongship = 0° , athwartship = -45° , rotation = 90°

*Notes:*

* You may define the pointing direction of the transducer with whichever pair of angles is most convenient for your application but the rotation angle will be the same, whichever pair of angles you choose to define the pointing direction.

* For a transducer with an elevation of 0° (that is, vertically downward pointing), the azimuth angle is logically equivalent to the transducer rotation.
