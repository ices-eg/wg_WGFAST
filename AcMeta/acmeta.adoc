== Background and Terms of reference
:sectnums:

The ICES Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics, Science and Technology (WGFAST) meeting in 2010, San Diego USA recommended the formation of a Topic Group that will bring together a group of expert acousticians to develop standardised metadata protocols for active acoustic systems. Through annual meetings in 2011-2013 and email correspondence the Topic Group on Acoustic Metadata (TG-AcMeta) developed a metadata convention for active acoustic data which is presented in this document.

The terms of reference for TG-AcMeta were "`To develop standardised metadata protocols to suit requirements for data acquisition, processing, quality control and data dissemination of calibrated integrated active acoustic backscatter data. This includes data from a range of platforms such as Ships of Opportunity including research, merchant and commercial fishing vessels, moorings, AUV's and acoustic instruments such as calibrated single- and multi-beam acoustic systems.`"


== Purpose of this document

Metadata is data describing data, and should allow potential users to determine the fitness for their purposes of that data from the metadata alone, without having to access the actual data. A metadata convention is a systematic set of metadata attributes that have been developed to describe a particular genre or type of data. This document describes a metadata convention that details the attribute fields necessary to describe water column backscatter data obtained from active acoustic systems.

This convention is not intended to conform to general metadata standards, such as FGDC, ISO:19115/19139, etc., nor to describe a metadata profile consistent with such standards. Essentially it describes a set of attributes to be included with the acoustic data itself to make a fully self-documenting data set. In addition to these, it also defines best practice for storing and managing fisheries acoustic data by providing a standard approach. That said, the metadata elements described here include all those necessary to populate any aggregated (or even global) metadata catalogue describing the available bioacoustic datasets managed in multiple institutional repositories.

It is recommended that processed acoustic data is stored in SI units of linear s~v~ (m^-1^). Depending on the purpose, acoustic backscattering data is sometimes stored in a number of other forms including S~v~, volume backscatter in logarithmic form (dB re 1m^-1^), area backscattering coefficient s~a~ (m^2^ m^-2^), or scaled to nautical area scattering coefficient, s~A~ (aka NASC, m^2^ nmi^-2^) cite:[maclennan2002]. The actual form of the backscattering data needs to be specified as part of the data attributes and the dimensions of the echo integration cell also specified.

This convention was developed for processed acoustic data, but has relevance for archiving raw acoustic data. Processed acoustic backscatter data are generated by applying procedures to the instrument acquired acoustic data (i.e., raw data) that address data quality and calibration and, in many cases, resampling to a lower resolution than the acquired data. Unless stated otherwise in the metadata, appropriate calibration offsets and time varied gain (TVG) corrections will have been applied. Metadata attribute fields are provided that will allow description of processing procedures specific to the data set.

In many cases the cost of collecting acoustic data is significant and adhering to this metadata convention will facilitate the discovery, reuse, and exchange of processed acoustic data while ensuring its longevity.

== Global attributes

The metadata attribute fields in this document build on existing conventions and are presented following the netCDF (network Common Data Format) cite:[rew1990,unidata2017] format of global attributes. The global attributes describe the overall contents of the file and allow for data discovery. Global attributes can be thought of as conveying five kinds of information:

* What: What are the data in the dataset?
* Where: The spatial coverage of the data.
* When: The temporal coverage of the data.
* Who: Who produced the data?
* How: How were the data produced and how are they being made available?

All fields should be human-readable and can be of either '`character`' or '`numeric`' type. Where applicable, metadata attribute definitions will state that controlled vocabulary should be used. Use of controlled vocabulary aids consistency, accuracy, interoperability, and data discovery. Standard lists for controlled vocabulary developed specifically for this metadata convention are given in <<listControlledVocab>>. If the appropriate words are not present in the standard list users should provide their own terminology. The standard lists can be extended according to user feedback to accommodate new terminologies in future versions of this metadata convention.

Wherever possible, the global attributes are based on established authorities. In some instances the metadata attribute may cite other authorities, while other metadata attributes may be unique to this metadata convention. Where they exist, the relevant authority is cited for each of the attribute fields. A table of the various metadata authorities is given in <<metadataAuthorities>>.

The metadata attributes are grouped according to logical categories. This is done to help both author and reader navigate the metadata record, but it is important to note that this does not describe a formal hierarchical structure. The metadata record of this convention is effectively a continuous list. Thus each global attribute must have a unique name for it to be unambiguously identified. Attribute names that are sourced from existing authorities are by necessity identical to that used by the authority in order to facilitate automatic harvesting of metadata. To ensure uniqueness, non-authoritative attributes are prefixed with the category name of this metadata convention. White spaces or blank characters are not allowed in attribute names as these are not supported by some of the established authorities (e.g. CF, the NetCDF Climate and Forecast Metadata Convention) and the underscore '`_`' character is used instead. Specific categories of ship and mooring attributes have been developed for this current version of the metadata convention. Further development of metadata attribute fields for other acoustic systems (e.g. autonomous underwater vehicles, gliders, towed bodies, acoustic lenses, and parametric arrays) can be developed as required, following the form of existing conventions used in this document.

There is no constraint on the addition of extra metadata attributes to fully describe a dataset. Such extra attributes would be a super-set of the attributes of this convention and might be specific to a particular institution but their presence would not violate this convention.

== Implementation of metadata convention

This document describes a metadata convention for processed acoustic data. It is assumed that appropriate data and metadata management of unprocessed acoustic data files will be in place, discussion of which is beyond the scope of this document.

Processed acoustic data and metadata may be held in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, relational databases, Extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Network Common Data Form (netCDF) and Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). Storage of the data and associated metadata is a question of implementation and is not mandated or defined by this document. When choosing a data format some key considerations are ease of data exchange, visibility of data and metadata, and potential for automated harvesting of metadata. It is recommended that guidance and assistance from metadata experts is sought when realizing this metadata convention in a specific implementation format.

== Summary of metadata categories

Metadata Record:: Uniform resource identifier (URI) that uniquely identifies the metadata record.

Mission metadata:: Metadata that gives a high level description of the overarching initiative (e.g. mission, project, ocean observing system) under which the acoustic data were collected.

Cruise metadata:: Attributes that describe the cruise from which the acoustic data were acquired. Metadata should provide information that readily enables the cruise to be identified and be aware of cruise objectives, other instrumentation, and data acquired.

Ship metadata:: Attributes that describe the ship from which acoustic data were collected. Metadata should provide information that uniquely identifies the ship and its basic specifications to enable an understanding of the type of ship and its purpose.

Platform metadata:: Attributes that describe the platform from which acoustic data were collected.

Transect metadata:: Attributes that describe transect data. Transect metadata would normally apply to acoustic data from a moving platform.

Instrument metadata:: Attributes that describe the acoustic instrument that recorded the raw data from which the processed data were derived.

Ancillary instruments:: Attributes that provide the opportunity to list ancillary instruments that may be of relevance to the acoustic data set.

Calibration metadata:: Attributes that describe calibration procedures and calibration accuracy and precision.

Data acquisition metadata:: Attributes that describe the data acquisition process.

Data processing metadata:: Attributes that describe the data processing procedures. Data processing procedures may be complex and difficult to capture in a simple list of attributes. Therefore links to documents that give more comprehensive descriptions of processing procedures should be given if appropriate.

Dataset metadata:: Attributes that describe the set of data. Some attributes will vary with each data file and may be automatically generated from the data file. When possible, automatic generation of dataset attribute metadata is preferred to reduce effort and the possibility of human error. Other attributes will need to be manually generated. In many cases attributes may be unchanged between datasets; hence the use of a metadata template which includes stable attributes may be beneficial.

Data metadata:: Attributes that describe the data in a dataset, including the type of scattering quantity that is stored and the data horizontal and vertical dimensions.

== Description of metadata category table headers

Attribute name:: Unique name for the attribute. When possible, names will conform to existing standards. Non-authoritative attributes are prefixed with the category name to ensure that they are unique. For example the 'name' attribute for cruise and ship categories are prefixed to be cruise_name and ship_name respectively. White space or blank characters are not allowed and the underscore Â´_Â´ character is used instead. For this metadata convention all attribute fields are lowercase.

Definition:: Description of attribute.

Data type:: S for string, N for numeric

Units:: If applicable, the units to be used for numeric attributes, using the SI standard.

Authority:: Where they exist, the relevant authority is cited for each of the attribute fields. The field is left blank if no authority exists.

Obligation:: Following Dublin Core documentation cite:[dublincore2004], Obligation '`indicates whether the element is required to always or sometimes be present. In this application profile, the obligation can be: mandatory (M), mandatory if applicable (MA), strongly recommended pass:[(R)] or optional (O). Mandatory ensures that some of the elements are always supported and mandatory if applicable means that this element must be supported if the information is available. An element with a mandatory obligation must have a value. The strongly recommended and the optional elements should be filled with a value if the information is appropriate to the given resource but if not, they may be omitted.`' An example of an MA field would be attributes in the mooring table that are only populated if the data relates to the mooring in some way.

Maximum occurrences:: Specifies the maximum number of instances of the attribute. Single occurrences are shown by '`1`'. Multiple, but specified number of occurrences, are indicated by '`N`'. A fixed number of occurrences are allowed (e.g., '`2`', '`3`', etc). For example, if the data comes from a cruise then the attribute field cruise_name is mandatory and applicable and has a maximum occurrence of 1.

Simrad refers to this as Transducer Gain with symbol 'G' in their EK60 manual. Note: manufacturers of other echosounders may express calibration in different terms and users are encouraged to propose new attributes be added to this metadata convention that will meet their specific needs.

=== Category: Data attributes

It is usual and recommended for the cell dimensions (ping-axis interval and range-axis interval) to be stored for each data value to be stored with the data. These cell dimensions should also be defined in the metadata if possible. If cell dimensions do vary within the dataset then they cannot be specified in the metadata record and it will be essential that they are stored with the data. Similarly it is expected that time and position (if appropriate) of each data value will be stored with the data.

== Revisions

*Version 1.04. 21^st^ August 2014*

Added new category of attributes, 'data' which describe the data type being stored and its dimensions (i.e. cell size).

Altered obligations on attributes from Mandatory (M) or Mandatory if Applicable (MA) to recommended pass:[(R)] for ship_breadth, ship_tonnage, ship_engine_power, ship_noise_design and ship_acknowledgements.

Changed term data_processing_transceiver_gain to data_processing_on_axis_gain

Changed term data_processing_transceiver_gain_units to data_processing_on_axis_gain_units

Minor edits to improve readability in "`Purpose of this document`" section.

Added new attribute of "`Convention`" to the Metadata category.

*Version 1.10. 10^th^ May 2016.*

The ICES Data Centre (Hjalte Parner, Nils Olav Handegard) are constructing an Acoustic Trawl Survey database with the intention of implementing the ICES Acoustic Metadata Standard. Through this process a number of new and existing attribute fields were discussed. This revision documents the consequent changes that were made as described below.

Add:: Category: Cruise attributes: cruise_summary_report attribute.

Add:: Category: Ship attributes: ship_platform_code using ICES database

Add:: Category: Ship attributes: ship_platform_class using ICES database

Add:: Category: Data processing: data_processing_triwave_correction

Minor edits to wording of Category Mooring: mooring_uplimit, mooring_downlimit, mooring_z_units.

Minor edits to wording of Category Transect: transect_uplimit, transect_downlimit, transect_z_units.

Minor edits to wording of Category Dataset: uplimit, downlimit and z_units.

Add:: Category: Metadata record: convention_version

Revised convention version. Previous versions were using a decimal number series - e.g. version 1.01, 1.02 etc. limiting the minor number series to 99 revisions. This revision alters the convention to follow the more common convention in the computer world where the version number is described by two integers separated by a full stop. Thus following this convention our previous version 1.05 would now be version 1.5, that is the 5^th^ revision in version 1 series. This version 1.10 is the 10^th^ revision of the version 1 series.

Revised:: Category: Data attributes: data_range_axis_interval to data_range_axis_interval_type for consistency with attribute for vertical dimension: data_ping_axis_interval_type.

Add:: Category: Data attributes: data_range_axis_interval_value

*Version 2.0. 17^th^ Feburary 2020*

Major revision. Added 'platform' category to allow long list of platform classes to be supported. These class types are defined by ICES controlled vocabulary. Mooring category attributes have been removed and can now be specified using the set of platform attributes.
