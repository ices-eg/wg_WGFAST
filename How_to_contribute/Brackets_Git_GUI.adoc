These are basic instructions on how to use the Git/GitHub GUI in Brackets.


If you want more detailed information on how to use Brackets to manage your Git repositories on GitHub, http://practicalseries.com/1002-vcs/index.html#js--000000[this] is a nice online reference.

== Git/GitHub GUI in Brackets
1. Make sure the https://github.com/brackets-userland/brackets-git[Git extension] for Brackets is installed. +
2. Before opening Brackets create an empty directory where you would like to repository to go. Name this folder, `wg_WGFAST`.

=== Clone
1. Open Brackets, go to `File -> Open Folder...`, and navigate to the `wg_WGFAST` folder you just created. +
2. Open the Git extension by clicking on its icon on the right side of the screen. image:Brackets_Git_icon.png[] +
3. Click on image:Brackets_clone_button.png[]. +
4. Go to your forked repository in GitHub and copy the HTTPS address to the clipboard. See <<2_suggested_workflow.adoc#Clone the forked repository to your local computer,Clone the forked repository to your local computer>> in the Suggested Workflow file. +
5. In Brackets, add the HTTPS address to "Enter Git URL of the repository you want to clone:". +
Your user name will replace "erinann" in the GitHub address. +
Do not enter your GitHub username and password if your credentials are managed elsewhere. +

=== Add upstream repository
1. In the Git extension, click on the image:Brackets_origin_button.png[] button. +
2. Choose _Create new remote_. +
3. You can name your new remote anything you would like, but Git parlance would suggest calling it, `upstream`. +
4. Add the URL to the `ices-eg/wg_WGFAST` repository. +
https://github.com/ices-eg/wg_WGFAST +

When you want to get updates from the upstream remote repository (`ices-eg/wg_WGFAST`): +
1. Make sure you are on the `master` branch. +
2. Change the remote to `upstream`. +
3. Click on the `Fetch` button. +

Note: You will also have to use the `Pull` button. I have not done this yet as no pull requests have been merged to `master` in the upstream repository. Will update soon.

=== New branch
1. Click on the drop down arrow next to the branch icon. The default branch is image:Brackets_GUI_default_branch.png[] +
2. Select _Create new branch..._ . +
3. Make sure the origin branch is `master` then add a name for your working branch. +
*NAMING your branch* - You can name your branch anything you want, but please name it something descriptive. In the example below the branch is named with the author's initials and a SHORT description of the branch's purpose. +

=== Edit files
Open a file and edit it. +

To open the AsciiDoc live preview pane, click on the AsciiDoc extension on the right side of the screen. image:Brackets_Asciidoc_icon.png[] +
The extension icon will only be present if an AsciiDoc document is open. +

  Add a commit message, and click `OK`. If you need to add more information than 50 characters will allow, click on the `EXTENDED` button in the upper, right corner to extend the text box. +

_Please follow best practices when writing commit messages_. +

2. A dialog box will appear. +
Make sure you are pushing to the correct branch of your remote repository, which will most likely be the current tracking branch (the one that is checked out). +
You do not have to fill out your username and password if your credentials are managed elsewhere. +
Click `OK`. +
